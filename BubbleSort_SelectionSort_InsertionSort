Bubble Sort:

How it works?

    1. we have an array, this algorithm will partition the array into sorted and unsorted.

    2. Start from left, i.e. index = 0. It checks if the next number is greater (0 index vs 1 index). If greater, do nothing. If less, perform a swap.

    3. increment index = 1 .... this stops when index == partitionIndex (array length -1)

    4. after one cycle, partitionIndex will become array length -2 cause the last to numbers are sorted.

        ******

In-Place Algorithm: Does not need another array for sorting. It is done using single array.

Time-Complexity: O(n^2) - quadratic
    100 steps to sort 10 items
    10,000 steps to sort 100 items

Stable vs Unstable sort:

Let's say we have an array with 5 elements.
Two of them are 9.
One is black 9 and other one is white.
White is in index 1, black is in index 3.

If it is unstable sort, then the relative order will not matter. Therefore, the while 9 will cross the black 9.

In Stable sort, the relative order is preserved. The white 9 will not cross the black 9.

Stable sort > UnStable sort

Bubble sort is stable sort.

Selection Sort:

    This Algorithm also partitions the array into sorted and unsorted.

    Step 1:
        Largest = element at 0th index.
        lastUnsortedIndex = 6
        i = 1; index used to traverse the array from left to right.

    Step 2:
        Compare index 0 and 1, 1>0?
            then largest = 1(index)
            i = 2
        compare index 1 and 2, 2<1?
            then i = 3

    Step 3:
        first traversal completes when i = lastUnsortedIndex
        swap 6th index value with largest
            lastUnsortedIndex = 5
            i = 1
            largest = index 0


        ******

Selection Sort is In-Place algorithm. No extra space is used.

Time-Complexity: O(n^2)

Less swapping when compared to bubble sort, so it'll perform better.

It is UnStable Algorithm.
